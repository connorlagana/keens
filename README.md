# Keen's Steakhouse

Keen's Steakhouse is a widely renown steakhouse. They offer top quality steaks that don't come cheap. While their food might be good, their website...well isn't.
I found it to be entertaining to redesign and remake their website to practice my CSS skills with some friends!

### The Process

The design and wireframes were done entirely by UX/UI designers. After the designs were transfered to the programmers via Zeplin, my team and I worked to perfect the final code to look as similar to the design wireframes as possible.
